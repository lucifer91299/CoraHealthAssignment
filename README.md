Assignment is to make a specific “Add to Cart” button component product detail page for an e-commerce company

The product detail page contains

An image of the product

Product Brand, Product Name

Price/discounts

Product description (long lorem ipsum, as long as the length of screen)

Add to cart button

Information about delivery dates

Cancellation policy

Refund policy

Similar products (side scrolling images)

The goal is to make Add to cart button so that it is always fixed to the bottom of the screen, but until the user scrolls downwards to position 6 (Information about delivery dates), after which the add to cart button will no longer be fixed but will move along with the rest of the components

In other words, if the user is at position 1-4, the add-to-cart button should be visible and fixed to the bottom of the screen (Even if the current scroll position shows 1-3 on the screen). However, if the user scrolls past the add-to-cart button position (position 5), the button scrolls up along with the rest of the product details and the user now sees the info about delivery dates, cancellation policy, etc.

All the details (images/text) are to be filled up with lorem ipsum https://www.lipsum.com/ or random images, please do not spend any time on those details or their layout. The goal is just to make this fixed-and-floating add-to-cart button
